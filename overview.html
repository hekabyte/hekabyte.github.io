		<p>Everything is a square.</p>

		<p>Squares can learn spells.</p>

		<p>Spells modify squares.</p>

		<p>In fact, the game world itself is created and managed by powerful dieties casting spells.</p>

		<p>Technically, it is possible for players to become as powerful as these dieties... (but it would take a very, very, very, very long time)</p>
